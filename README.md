# Credits
Extremely awesome free tokens used courtesy of Devin's Tokens (https://immortalnights.com/tokens/token-usage-rights/)
NOTE: For a small price Devin will customize existing tokens for you, or you can commission a custom token to meet your needs! (https://immortalnights.com/order-a-custom-token/) He's also got some even more awesome premium token sets! (https://immortalnights.com/product-category/sci-fi-3/)

All of the other tokens included in the pack were produced by me using Photoshop to create "coin" token images from computer generated images produced using https://artbreeder.com
